This project is for the Star Wars RPG game!

This project is live on https://rajdhandus.github.io/unit-4-game/

You can start playing the game by choosing a character. The remaining characters are available to fight against. Every time you hit the fight button, your health points as well as the enemy's health points will go down. Order in which you choose the characters matter. When you survive each fight your attack point increases. So - choose a weaker enemy to start with :)

* rajdhandus maintains the project
* create an issue for new feature requests or bugs
